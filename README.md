# Portfolio
This portfolio contains a collection of assignments that demonstrate use of mastered skills in R Programming.

**The following assignments are included:**

**Function Tutorial:** This file explains and demostrates the use of the functions: `read.fs.volume`, `image.animate`, and `str_sub`. I created it for an assignment for my Intro to R Programming course.

**Joins and Statistics:** This file contains the solutions to a homework assignment for my Intro to R Programming course. It covers topics such as data wrangling, data identification, interpretation of statistical tests, including ANOVA and Regression.

**R Markdowns and Data Wrangling:** This file contains the solutions to a homework assignment for my Intro to R Programming course. It covers topics such as formatting R Markdown files, data wrangling, and using dplyr functions: `filter`, `select`, and `mutate`.

**Statistics Part 2:** This file is a continuation of the topics covered in "Joins and Statistics". It goes into further depth on statistical tests such as ANCOVA and AIC.
